### Warning
We are using Heroku to host a demo version of this project and to do "build on deploy" TypesSript, and other `@types` dependencies are required; therefore, we have added them as normal dependencies.

Here are the TypeScript (development) dependencies:
```json
... {
  "@types/cors": "^2.8.7",
